# Random Quote Machine (React.js)

A front-end web app that gets and displays an inspirational quote at random from my own Express.js [Quotes API](https://autumnchris-quotes.herokuapp.com). Built with React.js.

Inspired by the [Build a Random Quote Machine challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) as part of the curriculum for the [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
